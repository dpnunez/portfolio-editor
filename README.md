# üé® **Portfolio** - Code Editor Simulation ‚ú®

Welcome to **Portfolio 2025**, a modern, interactive landing page that simulates a sophisticated code editor. This project is designed to showcase my front-end development skills and deliver an engaging, immersive experience. Whether you're exploring my projects or interacting with the editor, you'll see how I use modern technologies to create seamless and functional web experiences.
